And honestly Maâ€™am, I was so nervous making this Iâ€™ve built apps, closed deals, even pitched to investors. But thisâ€¦ this made me feel like a kid showing their first drawing to their favorite teacher.

I know itâ€™s a little childishÂ  maybe even silly. I couldâ€™ve built something way bigger, more complexâ€¦ but time didnâ€™t allow that.

Still, I hope this tiny attempt made you smileÂ  because itâ€™s built not just with code, but with admiration. ðŸ©µ</p>
